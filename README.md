Video Object Detection System
This repository contains a video object detection system built using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The system uses a pre-trained SSD MobileNet V2 model to detect and classify objects in each frame of a given video and outputs a processed video with bounding boxes drawn around detected objects.
Features

1.Real-time video object detection using SSD MobileNet V2.
2.Displays object categories and detection confidence scores.
3.Generates an output video with detection results.
4.Supports video file input (.mp4).

Requirements
Hardware Requirements:

5.At least 4GB of RAM.
6.GPU (Optional, but recommended for faster inference).

Software Requirements:

7.Python 3.x
8.TensorFlow 2.x
9.OpenCV
10.NumPy

Installation
Step 1: Install Python dependencies
You can install all required libraries via pip:
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy

Step 2: Download Pre-trained Model
Download the SSD MobileNet V2 pre-trained model from the TensorFlow model repository:

11.SSD MobileNet V2 model (or find the latest model version on TensorFlow's model zoo).
12.Save the downloaded model to the project directory.

Step 3: Prepare the Input Video
Place your input video file (input_video.mp4) in the project directory.

Usage
Step 1: Load the Model
The model is loaded from the saved pre-trained weights using TensorFlow. The script uses saved_model.load() to load the model.
model = tf.saved_model.load('saved_model')

Step 2: Run the Script
Run the Python script to process the input video:
python object_detection_video.py

This script will:

13.Load the input video (input_video.mp4).
14.Process each frame with the pre-trained SSD MobileNet V2 model.
15.Draw bounding boxes around detected objects along with their categories and confidence scores.
16.Save the processed video as output_video.mp4 in the same directory.

Step 3: Output Video
The processed video will be saved as output_video.mp4. It will display the bounding boxes and class labels for all detected objects in each frame.

Example

17.Input video (input_video.mp4):

18.Processed output video (output_video.mp4):



Parameters

19.Threshold: You can adjust the detection confidence threshold to filter out lower-confidence predictions by changing the threshold parameter in the code.
20.Model Path: Ensure the path to the saved model is correct, replace 'saved_model' with the actual path to your model folder.


Common Issues
1. Slow Processing Speed

21.If you don't have a GPU, processing might be slow. Consider running the script on a machine with GPU support for faster inference.

2. Model Detection Accuracy

22.The model may not be perfect, especially for small or overlapping objects. You can experiment with different models or fine-tune them for better results.
